# Note: Max VM ram allocated 12GB (leave al least 2gb for the OS)

# Xmx and Xms set the maximum and minimum RAM usage, respectively.
# They can take any number, followed by an M (for megabyte) or a G (for gigabyte).
# For example, to set the maximum to 3GB: -Xmx3G
# To set the minimum to 2.5GB: -Xms2500M

# A good default for a modded server is 4GB. Do not allocate excessive amounts of RAM as too much may cause lag or crashes.
# Uncomment the next line to set it. To uncomment, remove the # at the beginning of the line.
